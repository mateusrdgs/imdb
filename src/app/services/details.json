It's a well-oiled racket that Marla and her business-partner and lover, Fran, use with brutal efficiency on their latest \"cherry,\" Jennifer Peterson - a wealthy retiree with no living heirs or family. But when their mark turns out to have an equally shady secret of her own and connections to a volatile gangster, Marla is forced to level up in a game only predators can play - one that's neither fair, nor square.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"J Blakeson","directorList":[{"id":"nm2128335","name":"J Blakeson"}],"writers":"J
